# MCMA Launch Control and Monitoring

This repository contains the MCMA Launch Control and Monitoring project. This tool is a cloud-hosted web application that allows configuring, deploying and monitoring your MCMA-enabled media workflows. 

This is achieved through user-friendly GUI where you can compose you cloud environment by selecting from registered pre-packaged MCMA micro-services and workflows. After deployment the application allows inspecting and monitoring the state of the cloud infrastructure and the individual workflows. The cloud infrastructure can be shut down at the click of a button.

## Important note

As this is still work in progress, please checkout the [development branch](https://github.com/ebu/mcma-launch-control/tree/develop) for the current status.
